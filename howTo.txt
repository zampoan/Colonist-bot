# Project Steps
# 1. Template Matching
#       Template Matching uses a smaller image to find the location of where that small image appears in a larger image. It uses
#       cv.matchTemplate() for this purpose. It works by sliding the template image over an input image and compares the two together. 
#       It returns a greyscale image
